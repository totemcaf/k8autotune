# k8autotune - Automatic Tuner for Kubernetes

This service evaluates POD parameters to determine a better configuration to improve the resource use reducing the total number of nodes a cluster will need.

The current *resources* spec is taken from the POD controller and K8AutoTune will monitor the POD activity so both values will be checked adjusting their values if there is a big gap between both values.

Different strategies will be allowed to decide the best value for each use profile.

# Roadmap

## Version 0.1

* [ ] Handle Deployments

* [ ] Automatically adjust CPU ussage
* [ ] Use Prometheus as metrics source
* [ ] Update limit if needed

## Pending
* [ ] Allow to configure namespaces to include
* [ ] Persist metrics ussage locally in file system
* [ ] Automatically adjust Memory ussage
* [ ] Allow to annotate objects to configure behaviour
* [ ] Configure by custom resource
* [ ] Emit allert of changes
* [ ] Emit allert of exceptional conditions (like possible memory leaks)
* [ ] Take into account warm-up times for heavy PODs (like those that use a JVM)
* [ ] Let one controller to stabilize before tuning next
* [ ]
